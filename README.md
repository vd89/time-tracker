### üéä Welcome to your Test Task!

- This is a test task for you. The challenge is to develop a simple Time-Tracking Application, so we
  can understand how you write code and approach the solution.

- For this purpose, one customer has defined some user stories. It's up to you how the features are
  implemented as long as they make customers happy.

### ü§© Features

There should be two sections

1. Timer Section

- Digital Clock should show timer time in HH:mm:ss format (like stopwatch in your smartphone).
- Three buttons should be there Start, Pause and Save
  - Start - Start the timer
  - Pause - Pause the timer
  - Save - Save the task
- Timer can be in three stages
  - Started Stage - timer is started, only Pause and Save buttons should be enabled, Start
    button should become disabled
  - Paused Staged - Timer is paused, only Save and Start buttons should be enabled, Pause
    button should become disabled
  - Save Staged - timer along with task details should be saved
- When Save is clicked, one modal should be opened to save the task.

  - Modal should be having two fields, Title and Description

  to save the task.

### üèåAnd Now,

Have lots of fun, we are very excited to see your solution! Talk to you soon.

### ‚öíÔ∏è How to do it?

- Preferred would be usage of React in the frontend.
- For styling purposes you can use Bootstrap/React-Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, CSS, CSS Modules, or
  any other css library of your choice.
- You can create a README.md file to explain your solution, if you want.
- You should not be using any package/library apart from styling purposes.
- Do not include node_modules in the zip, and should not copy functionality from internet.
